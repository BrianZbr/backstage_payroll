# Backstage Payroll

A simple payroll database/API for managing contract-based work, built on Postgres and Flask. It is being designed with theater, movie and television technicians in mind but should be flexible enough to use for other fields where work is paid at different rates to multiple employees by contract or "gig". Keeps records of employees, contract assignments, hours worked, paychecks and more. It is NOT secure or production ready and should not be used to store real data.
